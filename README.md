# SynapTwin

## 🌟 **Inspiration**  
Mental health is often treated as an afterthought. we coul'dnt just stand by when One in five adults worldwide experience mental illness each year, yet over 60% of those affected receive no treatment. Stress related disorders are among the leading causes of disability, and studies show that we are far more likely to empathize with physical pain than emotional distress. You don't realize you're burning out until you're already engulfed in flames. You don't recognize anxiety creeping in until it's wrapped around your chest like a vice. We've all been there, pushing forward, ignoring the warning signs, until suddenly, our bodies force us to stop.

What if technology could intervene before that breaking point? What if your digital twin could recognize stress in real time and gently guide you back to balance?

That’s why we built SynapTwin, a system that visiulizes your emptional state and acts as a personalized safety net for mental wellness. A system that listens, understands, and responds when you need it most.
