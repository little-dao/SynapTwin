**Heart Rate:** 48.65 bpm
**EDA (avg):** 0.0302
**Temp change:** 0.15Â°C
**Summary:** Hey there!  Let's take a look at this data together.  It's just a tiny snapshot in time (only one second!), so we can't draw any definitive conclusions, but we can make a few general observations.

* **Low EDA and Zero EDA Variability:** Your electrodermal activity (EDA) is very low, and there's no variation at all.  EDA is related to sweat gland activity, which is influenced by the sympathetic nervous system (your "fight or flight" response). Low EDA and no variability *typically* suggest a state of calmness and relaxation.  You likely weren't experiencing any significant stress or excitement during that particular second.

* **Low Heart Rate:**  48.65 bpm is a pretty low resting heart rate for most adults.  This could indicate good cardiovascular fitness, or it could just be how your body naturally functions. Again, pointing towards a relaxed state.  It's important to remember that many factors influence heart rate, like sleep, medications, and individual differences.

* **Slight Skin Temperature Increase:** A small increase in skin temperature could be related to a number of things, from ambient temperature changes to normal fluctuations. It's hard to interpret this on its own without more context.

Overall, this one-second snapshot suggests you were likely pretty relaxed at 20:36.  However, it's really important to remember that this is a *very* brief period, and these metrics can change rapidly.  For a more complete picture of your stress, focus, and overall well-being, you'd need to look at longer durations of data and consider trends over time.  Keep tracking!
